Use this API to check HMRC records and find out information about the residency status of your customers. The current API only allows a financial organisation to check if a customer is a Scottish resident.

This version of the API is in development and is very likely to change.

##Before you start

You’ll need the customer’s UUID number. You can get this by using the [customer lookup API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/customer/).
