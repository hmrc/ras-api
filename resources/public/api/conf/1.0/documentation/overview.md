Use this API to check HMRC's records and find out information about your customers.

This version of the API is in development and is very likely to change.

Currently, the current API only allows a financial organisation to:

  * match a customer with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) records   
  * check if a customer is a Scottish resident
