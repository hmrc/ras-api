This API allows financial organisations to validate and retrieve tax status information against HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) records.

This version of the API is in development and is very likely to change.

The current API allows the financial organisation to:

  * match a customer record with HMRC    
  * request a relief-at-source status after the customer information has been matched.
