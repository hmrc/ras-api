You can use the sandbox environment to [test this API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing).
It does not support [stateful behaviour](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing/stateful-behaviour),
but you can use the payloads described in the resources to test specific scenarios.

Please refer to the service [schemas](https://github.com/hmrc/ras-api/tree/master/resources/public/api/conf/1.0/schemas) to create additional payloads.
