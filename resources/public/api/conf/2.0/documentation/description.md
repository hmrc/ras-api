Pension Scheme Administrators can find out if a pension scheme member pays tax in Scotland, Wales or in the rest of the UK. They can apply the correct rate of Income Tax to their relief at source contributions.

From 1 January to 5 April, the API will return currentYearResidencyStatus and nextYearForecastResidencyStatus.

From 6 April to 31 December, the API will only return currentYearResidencyStatus.
